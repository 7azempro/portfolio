## The Paralysis of Choice

In traditional financial interfaces, density was often mistaken for power. The more data we could jam onto a screen, the more "professional" it felt. But for the end-user, this created a cognitive load that was paralyzing.

### Structuring Chaos

When we redesigned the main dashboard, we didn't just remove data—we restructured it. By introducing a modular **widget system**, we allowed users to:
1. Prioritize what matters to *them*.
2. Hide noise.
3. Build their own workflows.

This approach reduced our churn rate by **25%** within the first quarter.
